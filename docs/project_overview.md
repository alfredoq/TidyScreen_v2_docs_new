`TidyScreen` is a Python library developed with the purpose of providing a structured platform for the execution of small, medium and large scale virtual drug screening campaigns (***VDSC***). 

A typical ***VDSC*** encompases the following stages:

- Setting up of working chemical space (***WCS***);
- Analysis/subseting/prioritization of compounds within the working ***WCS***;
- Preparation of candidates for molecular docking assays;
- Obtention/processing/parameterization of a target receptor;
- Execution of molecular docking assays;
- Analysis of molecular docking results;
- Advancing selected candidates to molecular dynamics simulations;
- Exhaustive processing of molecular dynamics trajectories.

`TidyScreen` includes objects and classes that facilitate the execution and registry of all these stages, thus not only configuring but also registering the actions take during the **VDSC**

In the following sections, the execution of all these steps will be described in detail.
