title: 6. Key Takeaways
---

- Structure-based virtual drug discovery campaigns constitutes highly customizable workflows, thus we cannot expect to follow a unique protocol to solve diverse biomedical projects. Very often a diverse number of receptor models should be managed.
- The amount of data managed within the project increases exponentially as the it advances.
- Being ordered/structured in the execution of the studies constitute a critical point very early in the execution of the project.
- SQL databases are highly adapted to assist in the management of the information involved in the project.
- vHTS is a highly iterative process.
- Being able to execute vHTS workflow using remote connections to computational infrastructure is highly desired.
- As technical requirements for the project may be very diverse, the combination of multiple tools is often required. In this respect, workflows based on open source tools are highly desirable.
