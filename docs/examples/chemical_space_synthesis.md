### Creating a custom chemical space using in silico synthesis

In this worked example we are going to follow the steps required to reproduce the construction of a virtual chemical space as reported by [Cerutti et al](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/17/4224).

The execution of a virtual drug screening campaing encompasess diverse medicinal chemisty objectives, with each project constituting a unique scientific scenario. In this example, the aim of the work was to design potential triazole-based targeted covalent inhibitors of the antichagasic target Cruzipain.

In this case, the researchers plans to perform a combinatorial exloration of R1, R2 and R3 on a central scaffold of 1,2,3-triazole. The core sythetic strategy is based on the use of Cu(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction as is shown in Figure 1.

As can be seen, three starting building blocks are required to construct the intended chemical space:

- Aminoacids
- Secondary amines
- Aldehides

Also a trimethylsilyl (TMS) is involved early in the reaction workflow in order protect aminoacids prior to the azide formation stage.
